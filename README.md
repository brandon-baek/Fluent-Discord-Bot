# Fluent Discord Bot


## A Translation Bot

Fluent is a Translation Bot that uses Google Translate. Google Translate has a questionable reputation for translations, but compared to most, it is still top of the line.

## Automatic Translation

When enabled, Fluent can automatically translate any message sent in a channel. You can enable and disable Fluent in certain channels. When a message is sent, Fluent will automatically delete the message and resend a well-formatted embed containing translations for the original message in every language that has been selected. Users can select what languages messages should be translated into. The embed contains the username of the sender, the original message, and a list of translations for languages that are selected.

For better differentiation between users, every user will be assigned a random color. This color will be the accent color for the embed, making all embeds unique to the sender. Any files sent with a text that should be translated will be added as an extra file link. If a message does not require any translation or it is just a file, the message will not be transformed into an embed.

## Translate

Fluent can also just regularly translate text into any language a user wants.

## No Filter

Fluent does not have ANY filter. Users can converse any way they want without having to worry about getting censored.
